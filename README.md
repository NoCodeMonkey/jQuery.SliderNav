jQuery.SearchSliderNav
======================

SearchSliderNav is a modification of the [SliderNav](http://devgrow.com/slidernav/) JQuery plugin by Monji Dolon.

SliderNav is a JQuery plugin that lets you add dynamic, sliding content using a vertical navigation bar (index).
It is made mainly for alphabetical listings but can be used with anything, though longer words can look a bit awkward.

SearchSliderNav has all the features of SliderNav along with an added search option which will filter through the
list and highlight any matches it finds.
