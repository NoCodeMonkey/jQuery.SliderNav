jQuery.SliderNav with Search
============================

SliderNav with Search is a modification of the [SliderNav](http://devgrow.com/slidernav/) JQuery plugin by [Monji Dolon](http://mdolon.com/).

SliderNav is a JQuery plugin that lets you add dynamic, sliding content using a vertical navigation bar (index).
It is made mainly for alphabetical listings but can be used with anything, though longer words can look a bit awkward.

SliderNav with Search has all the features of SliderNav along with an added search option which will filter through the
list and highlight any matches it finds.

For more information, please refer to see the SliderNav documentation at http://devgrow.com/slidernav/.

The original source code is currently hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/mdolon/SliderNav.
